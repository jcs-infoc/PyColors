# PyColors

`pycolors` lets you add colors your output text. This has been tested on Python 2.7.2 and Python 3.6.2.

## Usage
 ```
 from pycolors import *
 print(text.bold+"This text is bold"+end)
 print(highlight.blue+"This text is highlighted with the color blue"+end) 
 ```
 You have to have the `end` command at the teh end so that your whole terminal does not get modification you made.
 
 Use the `example.py` to see what commands there are and how they look like.
